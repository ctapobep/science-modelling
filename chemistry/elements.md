## Periodic Table

Column number says how many electrons there are at the outer shell. In this case columns that start too low vertically are not considered.

The most electronegative elements are at the top righ.

## Bonds
Atoms like when their outer shell is full. In Periodic Table, the column number is the number of electrons on the outer shell. If there is a way atoms can have their outer shell full, they can make bonds with other atoms.

###Ion Bonds
Form when one of atoms have too low number of electrons at the outer shell and another atom has almost full set. 
Then the one that has almost full set takes the electron from another atom and both are happy since both of them have full 
outer electrone shell. In this case both atoms become Ions - one of them becomes positively charged, and the other becomes
negatively charge. This electric difference makes them attract.

In Periodic Table because first columns have 1 or 2 electrons in the outer shell and last colums (except the very last since it's a Noble Gas) have almost full outer shell, these atoms like making Ionic bonds.

###Covalent Bonds
Form when atoms want to share (instead of take away) electrons. The more electrically negative the second atom is the more time electrons will spend near that atom and the molecule becomes polar.

Nomencature:
- H-H
- O=C=O

###Hydrogen Bonds
Because H is not-a-very-electronegative guy, electrons don't usually hang up with them too much and molecules usually are pretty polar. In this case H side forms a slightly positive end. Examples:
- surface tension in whater (several H2O molecules are connected with Hydrogen bonds). 
- Hold DNA molecules together. This is important since DNA needs to unzip often.
- Helps enzymes bind substrate molecules
- Helps antibodies bind antigen
