## Bonds
Atoms like when their outer shell is full. In Periodic Table, the column number is the number of electrons on the outer shell. If there is a way atoms can have their outer shell full, they can make bonds with other atoms.

###Ion Bonds
Form when one of atoms have too low number of electrons at the outer shell and another atom has almost full set. 
Then the one that has almost full set takes the electron from another atom and both are happy since both of them have full 
outer electrone shell. In this case both atoms become Ions - one of them becomes positively charged, and the other becomes
negatively charge. This electric difference makes them attract.

In Periodic Table because first columns have 1 or 2 electrons in the outer shell and last colums (except the very last since it's a Noble Gas) have almost full outer shell, these atoms like making Ionic bonds.
