Immune responses are results of 4 kinds of recognition:
- 

If we want a large adaptive immune response (no matter in animal or in human), when we inject an antigen, we also need some kind of adjuvant:
- Adjuvant signals the organism about the infection and that an adaptive response should take place (at the beginning there were dead microbes of Koch)
- Some kind of carrier is required so that antigens do not denaturate too fast.
- Otherwise the adaptive response will be pretty minor because there was no appropriate stimulation and antgens will denaturate too fast.


Cells always put internal particles into the membrane so that controlling cells can recognize them. If amongst those particles controlling 
cells recognize foreign combination, the cell is considered as infected and gets kiled. The way cells present their internals is: they take parts
of itself and get them integrated into MHC-I cells. Then T-cells recognize that this is an MHC-I and tries to inspect it - if there are strange
combinations of peptides, then it's considered as infected. Note that MHC-I is very unique to people and therefore some viral particles may
fit there nice or not-nice. If the particle fits nice and it's hard to recognize it, the viral infection can be poorly recognized. Other people
will have different MHC-I and therefore foreign particles might be recognized more easily.
