If we want a large adaptive immune response (no matter in animal or in human), when we inject an antigen, we also need some kind of adjuvant:
- Adjuvant signals the organism about the infection and that an adaptive response should take place (at the beginning there were dead microbes of Koch)
- Some kind of carrier is required so that antigens do not denaturate too fast.
- Otherwise the adaptive response will be pretty minor because there was no appropriate stimulation and antgens will denaturate too fast.
